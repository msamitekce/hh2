## General

This webpage is made for Haaga-Helia students. Frequently used links are brought together. Also it is possible to change displayed links on the main page.

Webpage is served on Netlify CD via GitHub repository.

Currently this project is in experimental state. You may lose your saved settings time to time because of updates.

## Usage

Webpage uses browser local storage to keep customizations. Users need to save choices on every browser they use. If you delete your browsers "Offline Website Data" you need to set your peferences again.


The main page has 2x4 grid for small screen sizes (width < 1025px>) and 4x2 for big screen sizes (width > 1024px) layout to keep everything simple. User can decide which links to be displayed and their position on the grid. 

During the first visit there is only **Menu** icon on the main page. This can be changed from **Menu > Main Page Layout**. You choose the position of any link based on the grid as:

```
For small screens sizes
Area 1  Area 2
Area 3  Area 4
Area 5  Area 6
Area 7  Area 8
```

```
For big screen sizes
Area 1  Area 2 Area 3  Area 4
Area 5  Area 6 Area 7  Area 8
```



### Main Page Layout

You can't choose same area for two different links. If you choose same area the button turns red and you can't save your settings. 

The *Menu* link can't be hide.

**Any area can be left empty.** 

### Lukkarikone Save

Lukkarikone doesn't keep user session for long time, you can't find your custom timetable without logging in. You can save your personal timetable as default on **hh2** and when you click on _Lukkarikone_ item on main page it opens saved timetable on Lukkarikone's webpage.

```
Add your courses to the "Study Basket"
Click on "View schedule"
Click on the star icon
Copy the "link location" then submit to here.
```
**Note:** There are is a blue colored "Link" on the Lukkarikone pop-up page (when you click on the star icon). On mobile, you can long press on "Link" text then choose "Copy link location", "Copy link address" or similar option depending on your browser. There is the text version of the link but it is very hard to copy on mobile.  


### Links

There are most used links in one place ordered alphabetically.

### Moodle Calendar

This is the page where we don't have direct access via other links on the Moodle but you can see your Moodle calendar (assignments mostly) or you can export it and add your calendar application or Outlook Calendar (is called **Calendar** on hh2).


## About

This webpage is made for Haaga-Helia students. I am inspired by Tomas Kukk's https://hhapp.info/. I had used hhapp as my homepage for long time. It is a great website but the purpose of it wasn't creating perfect mobile friendly homepage. Especially clicking on Moodle was painful on mobile so I decided to let everyone to choose their layout as they want.  

I can't test all possible different scenarios alone, if you have experienced some difficulties, glitches, problems or if you have another idea to add please send me an email.
