## General

This webpage is made for Haaga-Helia students. Frequently used links are brought together.

Webpage is served on Netlify CD via GitHub repository.

## Usage

Webpage uses browser local storage to keep customizations. Users need to save choices on every browser they use. If you delete "Offline Website Data" you need to set your peferences again or you can use default layout.

The main page has 2x3 grid layout to keep everything simple. User can decide which links to be displayed and their position on the grid. This can be by **Menu > Main Page Layout** user chooses the position of any link based on the grid as:

```
Area 1  Area 2
Area 3  Area 4
Area 5  Area 6
```

Any area can be kept empty. 

_Currently user isn't forced to add "Menu" item. Adding Menu to main layout is strongly recommended. if user prefers not to add, this Menu page can be reached by: hh2.fi/settings_

_There isn't any system that prevents users from choosing same area for different items. As you expected this will cause problems. The warning system will be implemented in next versions._

### Lukkarikone Save

Lukkarikone doesn't keep user session for long time, you can't find your custom timetable without logging in. You can save your personal timetable as default and when you click on _Lukkarikone_ item on main page it opens saved timetable on Lukkarikone's webpage.

```
Add your courses to the "Study Basket"
Click on "View schedule"
Click on the star icon
Copy the "link location" then submit to here.
```
**Note:** There are is a blue colored "Link" on the Lukkarikone pop-up page (when you click on the star icon). On mobile, you can long press on "Link" text then choose "Copy link location", "Copy link address" or similar option depending on your browser. There is the text version of the link but it is very hard to copy on mobile.  

If you save an empty input the Lukkarikone Input on Menu, it will assign Lukkarikone opening page as link location.

### Links

There are most used links in one place. We are familiar with most of them but there is one interesting link there, **"Moodle Calendar"**. It is the page where we don't have direct access via other links on the Moodle but you can see your Moodle calendar (assignments mostly) or you can export it and add your calendar application or Outlook Calendar (is called 'Calendar' on hh2).

## What's next?

There are several improvements needed.

The list currently looks like:

+Visual indicator when preferences saved successfuly  
+Warning when user selects same layout areas for different items  
+Making Menu item compulsory on the main layout (maybe?)
+Adding different color sets  
+Other minor adjustments   

## About

This webpage is made for Haaga-Helia students. I am inspired by Tomas Kukk's https://hhapp.info/. I had used hhapp as my homepage for long time. It is a great website but the purpose of it wasn't creating perfect mobile friendly homepage. Especially clicking on Moodle was painful for my thumb on mobile so I decided to let everyone to choose their layout as they want.  

I can't test all possible different scenarios alone, if you have experienced some difficulties, glitches, problems or if you have another idea to add please send me an email sami.tekce@myy.haaga-helia.fi

Thanks
